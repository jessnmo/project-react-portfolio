				<strong>Hi there, </strong>I'm Jessica. An Upcoming Frontend Developer
				who recently finished studying at Technigo Coding Bootcamp ðŸŽ‰. I have
				almost 6 years experience in Tech Talent Acquisition operations in major
				tech companies. Working with developers on a daily basis has inspired me
				to become a developer myself; not only because of my passion and
				curiosity for coding, but also the desire to explore the unknown,
				continuous learning and feeling supported by the tech community.
